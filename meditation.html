        <h1>Relief Techniques</h1>
    
        <div class="container">
            <div class="remedy">
                <h2>1. Heat Therapy</h2>
                <p>Heat therapy can help relieve menstrual cramps and pain by relaxing muscles, increasing blood flow, and easing tension. Here are some ways to use heat therapy for period pain: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heating pad: Sit with a heating pad on your lower stomach or back. Some heating pads can heat up quickly and run for several hours. You can also try spraying a heating pad with water to use it as a warm compress. </li>
                    <li>Hot water bottle: Fill a hot water bottle with warm water, wrap it in a cloth, and place it on your lower abdomen for 15–20 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Hot bath or shower: Take a hot bath or shower to help relieve period cramps. </li>
                   <li> You can also try experimenting with cold therapy, such as an ice pack, if a buildup of blood in your pelvis is causing your cramps.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="remedy">
                <h2>2. Herbal Tea</h2>
                <p>Herbal teas like chamomile, ginger, and peppermint have anti-inflammatory properties that can relieve pain and promote relaxation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <h4>Ingredients (1 mug):</h4>

                    <li>3 medium-sized jujube dates (about 20g)</li>
                    <li>4 dried longan fruits</li>
                   <li> 2 tsp goji berries</li>
                   <li>2 slices of fresh ginger</li>
                   <li> 1.5 cup of water</li>
                   <li> 1 tsp of osmanthus flower or 1 tbsp rose water</li>
                   <li> 3 droppers of Elix Healing Cycle Balance</li>
                   <h4> Method:</h4>
                    
                    <li>In a teapot, bring all ingredients, except for Cycle Balance, to a boil and turn off the heat to let it steep for 5-10 minutes. 
                    Add Cycle Balance. Drink warm!</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="remedy">
                <h2>3. Stay Hydrated</h2>
                <h3>Water, Water, Water</h3>
                <p>Drinking plenty of water can help reduce bloating, which makes cramps feel less severe.
                    Staying hydrated won't curb your cramping directly, but it can help with bloating, which makes cramps feel worse. When your period is coming, keep a water bottle handy, and toss in some mint or a squeeze of lemon to encourage you to drink.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="remedy">
                <h2>4.Nutritional supplements</h2>
                <p>Many women take supplements such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids to help with symptoms of PMS; however, not all supplements have been shown to help. Below is a list of supplements for which studies have demonstrated some scientific evidence for benefits, although with all of them, more research is required. Check with your doctor to ensure there are no risks with you trying these supplements. Some supplements may interact with medication.</p>
                <h3>Vitamins B6 and B1</h3>
                <li>May help with PMS.</li>
                <li>Reduces pain, cramps and mood disturbance. </li>
                <li>Do not exceed 50 mg of vitamin B6 daily or 100 mg vitamin B1. </li>
                <li>Best if combined as a multi-B vitamin, not as single nutrients. </li>
                <h3>Vitamin E (natural alpha-tocopherol) </h3>
                <li>Dose: 200 IU vitamin E daily; commence two days prior to periods and continue for three days from onset of periods.  </li>
                <li>May help reduce pain and menstrual blood flow.  </li>
                <li>Avoid high doses over 400 IU daily.</li>
                <h3>Magnesium  </h3>
                <li>Improves premenstrual mood changes, especially irritability and anxiety. </li>
                <li>Dose: 300 mg one or two times daily (best taken at night with calcium).    </li>
                <li>May lower blood pressure and cause heart arrhythmia, drowsiness and weakness in high doses.  </li>
                <li>May cause diarrhoea and loose stools; reduce dosage if this occurs.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="remedy">
                <h2>5. Diet</h2>
                <p>A growing body of evidence suggests diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as fish, calcium and vitamin D, and low in animal fats, salt and caffeine may reduce the risk of troublesome PMS symptoms. Avoiding salt can help reduce fluid retention, abdominal bloating, breast swelling and pain. High caffeine intake can cause irritability, poor sleep and menstrual cramps.
                </p>
                <p>A healthy diet is high in vegetables (five serves daily), fruit (two serves per day), nuts, seeds, fish (up to three servings per week) and other sources of omega-3 foods such as flax or chia seeds, low-fat dairy food, proteins such as legumes and eggs, and a variety of wholegrains such as rice (brown, basmati, doongara), traditional rolled oats, buckwheat flour, wholegrain breads (rye, essene, spelt, kamut), wholemeal pasta, couscous, millet or amaranth.</p>
                <p>Lean meat (red meat or chicken) is an important source of iron and protein, especially for women with heavy periods. Avoid saturated fats such as butter, cream, bacon and potato chips; limit salt and caffeine. Drink more water and herbal teas such as chamomile.

                 Increase your intake of calcium-rich foods such as nuts, low-fat dairy products, fish with bones such as salmon and sardines, tofu, broccoli and bok choy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="remedy">
                <h2>6. Massage with Essential Oils</h2>
                <p>Gently massaging your lower abdomen with essential oils like lavender or clary sage can relieve tension and ease cramps.</p>
